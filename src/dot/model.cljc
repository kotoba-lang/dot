(ns dot.model
  "Graphviz DOT language as EDN — the canonical graph model, a threading-friendly
  builder, and graph queries / algorithms. No I/O, no third-party deps — portable
  .cljc (JVM, ClojureScript, SCI).

  A graph is a map keyed by namespaced `:dot/*` keys:

    {:dot/id \"G\" :dot/strict false :dot/directed true
     :dot/graph-attrs {\"rankdir\" \"LR\"}
     :dot/nodes {\"a\" {:dot/id \"a\" :dot/attrs {\"shape\" \"box\"}}
                 \"b\" {:dot/id \"b\" :dot/attrs {}}}
     :dot/edges [{:dot/from \"a\" :dot/to \"b\" :dot/attrs {\"label\" \"x\"}}]}

  Nodes are id-keyed for O(1) lookup; edges are an ordered vector (DOT edge order
  is meaningful for rendering). Graph algorithms (topo-order etc.) sort by node id
  for deterministic output.")
